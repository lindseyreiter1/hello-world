Hi! My name is Lindsey. I am a fourth year at UVA, studying economics and statistics. I am in Greek life. I am in Gamma Phi Beta. Last year I held an elected position and this year I run our social media accounts. I am from NY and live 10 minutes from a beach. I have basically grown up on the beach and miss it dearly.
